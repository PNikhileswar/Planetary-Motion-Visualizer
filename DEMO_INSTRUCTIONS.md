- **Overview**: "This is a fully interactive 3D visualization of our solar system built with Three.js and vanilla JavaScript."
- **Show**: The main interface with the solar system in motion

### 2. Core Features Demonstration (60 seconds)

#### 3D Solar System in Motion
- **Show**: All 8 planets orbiting the sun at different speeds
- **Explain**: "Here you can see all 8 planets from Mercury to Neptune, each orbiting at realistic relative speeds."
- **Demonstrate**: Mouse controls - rotate, zoom, pan
- **Say**: "I can rotate the view with mouse drag, zoom with scroll wheel, and pan to explore."

#### Speed Control Feature
- **Show**: Control panel at bottom left
- **Explain**: "The key requirement was real-time speed control for individual planets."
- **Demonstrate**: 
  - Adjust Mercury's speed slider
  - Show Jupiter's speed control
  - Use global speed control
- **Say**: "I can adjust each planet's speed individually in real-time, or use the global speed control."

#### Pause/Resume Functionality
- **Show**: Pause button in header
- **Demonstrate**: Pause and resume animation
- **Say**: "The pause/resume feature stops all planetary motion instantly."

### 3. Technical Implementation (45 seconds)

#### Code Structure
- **Show**: File explorer with project structure
- **Explain**: "The project is organized into modular components:"
  - `planetData.js` - "Contains all planetary properties and configurations"
  - `solarSystem.js` - "Handles the 3D scene creation and animation logic"
  - `controls.js` - "Manages all UI interactions and speed controls"
  - `main.js` - "Coordinates the entire application"

#### Three.js Implementation
- **Show**: Browser dev tools console with some code
- **Explain**: "I used Three.js for 3D rendering with custom orbital mechanics calculations."
- **Mention**: "Each planet has realistic properties like size, color, distance, and orbital speed."

### 4. Bonus Features (30 seconds)

#### Additional Features
- **Show**: Theme toggle
- **Demonstrate**: Switch between dark and light themes
- **Show**: Planet hover tooltips
- **Demonstrate**: Hover over Earth to show information
- **Show**: Mobile responsiveness
- **Demonstrate**: Resize browser window or show on mobile device
- **Mention**: "Background starfield, smooth camera animations, and keyboard shortcuts."

### 5. Conclusion (15 seconds)
- **Summary**: "This 3D Solar System Visualizer meets all requirements with smooth animations, real-time speed controls, and bonus features."
- **End**: "Thank you for watching, and I look forward to discussing this project further!"

## Recording Setup Tips

### Screen Recording Settings
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- **Frame Rate**: 30 fps minimum
- **Audio**: Clear microphone with minimal background noise
- **Duration**: Keep it between 2-3 minutes maximum

### What to Show
1. **Full screen capture** of the browser running the application
2. **File explorer** showing project structure briefly
3. **Code editor** showing key files (optional, very brief)
4. **Console output** showing successful initialization
5. **Mobile/responsive view** if possible

### Recording Flow
1. Start with browser showing the application
2. Demonstrate core features systematically
3. Show code structure briefly
4. Demonstrate bonus features
5. End with a clear conclusion
